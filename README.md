# Factorio helper

I started with this tool to make a calculator for my wishes.

* Uses the Factorio data files directly, so ready for future updates
* Should have support for mods*, at least with some mods I use (Bobs, Ion Canon, possibly Angels)


_\* As long as they use the same data format as base factorio for items/recipes_

## TODO

- [ ] Parse mod list
- [ ] Read mod info files
- [ ] Define order of loading
- [ ] Appened mod paths to LUA_PATH
- [ ] Parse mod data files
- [ ] Take a look at smelting/rocketbuilding


## Roadmap

- [ ] Allow to specify location of Factorio folder (with some nice defaults)
- [ ] Allow to specify which assemblers you want to use
- [ ] Implement the above in a GUI :)
